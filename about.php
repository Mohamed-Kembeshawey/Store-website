	           When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives, share it. <br> 
		    The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context <br>
		    and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to <br> 
		    connect with them and pass them on.Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by <br> 
            describing how the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families. <br> 
            The company breaks down different pieces of the story into sections that combine words and easily digestible <br><br>
		    graphics, painting a picture instead of big chunks of text. They're clear about why they're <br> 
		    different: "Not a Charity," the page reads. And then: "This is the basis for a brighter future, built on <br> 
		    a hand up, not a handout." Every company has a story to tell, so break out your storytelling skills from that <br>
            random English class you took years ago and put them to work on your "About Us" page. <br> 
            Using descriptive and emotive copy and gorgeous graphics, an "About Us" page with a story works harder for <br> 
            your business than a generic one. <br>
